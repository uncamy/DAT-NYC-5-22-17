    "Answer: Our GPA is a contiuous range of numbers possibly between 0 and 4.  Our GRE is a continous range between 220 and 800.  The prestige of the undergraduate is a discrete number in buckets, either 1,2,3,4.  There were some missing variables in our data.  Since the number of observations with missing data was small we decided to drop those observations from our model.  We could have also calculated the mean of the data and put that in the missing data of the observation.  "
