> Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects and 1 Final Project (subdivided into 5 deliverables). Each builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

## Project Specs

Each project includes objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

> See our [feedback guidelines](./project-feedback.md) to read more about how to provide feedback on student projects.

- Complete and submit the final project, including all 5 milestones.

### Grading & Using GitHub in the Classroom
> The following recommendations assume instructors and students are all familiar with Github. If issues arise with assignment submission or grade release, alternative methods include using Dropbox or sending via email.

Instructors should create their own fork from the baseline curriculum to host their tailored course materials. Students should in turn create their own individual course repositories to store notes and host graded assignments.

Students should pull in weekly materials released by instructors to their individual repositories. Students can create pull requests to the instructor's course repo for short assignments or homework submission. Instructors can use the public comment feature to confirm receipt and leave high level feedback.

For project submission, students should link to their personal project commits so instructors can view their work. Instructors should in turn link students to a private gist for detailed project feedback and private graded rubrics.
