## REQUIRED TOOLS
Before the course starts, you should install and familiarize yourself with the following technologies:

- **[Github](www.github.com)** - Weâ€™ll be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code
- **[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)** - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language
- **[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)** - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)** - In addition to creating a Github account, you'll also need to install the command line tools for Git. Windows users should [install Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io)


## COMMON TOOLS
- **[Anacondas](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs)** is our primary tool for this course. It bundles many of the common packages we'll be using, including:

  - *Ipython / Jupyter / Pandas*: Core tools for creating notebooks 
  - *Matplotlib*: The Grandaddy of all python plotting packages
  - *Gensim*: Framework for vector modeling
  - *NLTK* & *Spacy*: Used for natural language processing
  - *NumPy*: Array processing tool
  - *Scikit-learn*: Modules for machine learning & data modeling
  - *SciPy*: Scientific library for python
  - *Seaborn*: Statistical data visualizer
  - *Pip* & *Setuptools*: package installer & version manager
  - *Sqlite*: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine
  - *Statsmodels*: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy)

## OPTIONAL TOOLS 
These tools aren't required, but they offer some additional functionality that some students may find helpful!
- **[Atom](https://atom.io)** or **[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - Popular text editors for writing code
- **[Import.io](https://www.import.io)** - a user-friendly web scraping tool
- **[Plot.ly](https://plot.ly)** - a user-friendly tool with a GUI and API for making graphs

## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

We here at GA care about both our Mac and PC users! If you are using a PC (or Linux machine), you may need to [follow some additional steps](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) to get your environment setup correctly. 

- **Compatibility Issues** - Python and Anacondas have some known issues with Windows 7 x64 machines. If you are running this OS, we recommend [installing a virtual machine](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images) in order to run Anacondas
